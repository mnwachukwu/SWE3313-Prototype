# SWE3313 Sprint 2
We picked **Sprint 2A**

The semester project to deliver the waiter component of an overall restaurant management system.

`Program.cs` is the heart of the program, and it's where you want to start. All UI elements are contained inside of a folder, `Forms`.

The program maintains its state in `Program.cs`. Data is pulled from `Employees.json` and `MenuItems.json`, included in the project.

### Example Accounts
Five example accounts exist. Their IDs and pins follow a scheme.

```
Manager Account - ID: 1001, Pin: 0001
First Waiter - ID: 1002, Pin: 0002
```

... and so on, all the way to ID 1005. You can see more about each employee in `Employees.json`.
